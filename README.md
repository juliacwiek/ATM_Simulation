## ATM Set-Up
1. After cloning the respository, right click the on the **Java** folder, and select **Mark Directory As** --> **Sources Root**
2. To access the ATM, you must log in as either an ATM worker (Bank Manager or Bank Advisor) or a customer. The text files **workers.txt** and **customers.txt**, both found in the **Files** folder, currently contain some usernames and passwords that you can use to log in. Every time a new worker or customer is created, the usernames and passwords of the new users will be written into these files respectively (for more information regarding the format of said text files, please see the 'Files' section of this README).
   - To log in as a Bank Manager, enter **bm** as the username, **123** for the password, and then press Bank Login
   - To log in as a Bank Advisor, enter **ba1** as the username, **123** for the password, and then press Bank Login 
   - To log in as a customer, create a new customer using a Bank Manager
3. One of the functionalities of this ATM is depositing money into a user's bank account. To store information regarding deposits, we use a file called **deposits.txt**. This file needs to be manually created. In the **files** folder, please create a new text file called **deposits.txt**. See the **Files** section of this README to see how to format information stored in deposits.txt.
